I am a second year PhD Student at [Paris School of Economics](https://www.parisschoolofeconomics.eu/en/) and EDF. My thesis is supervised by [Carine Staropoli](https://www.parisschoolofeconomics.eu/equipes/carine-staropoli/) (PSE), Corinne Chaton (EDF) and Val√©rie Lesgards (EDF). 

My research focuses on public policies for energy renovation for households in France. I seek to measure their efficiency and propose new subsidies designs that could help reduce innefficiency in renovation policies. More generally, I am interested in Environmental Economics, Behavioral Economics and Experimental Economics.
