abstract: > 
  Through a discrete choice experiment conducted among French homeowners, we determine whether easing financial constraints through two innovative capital provision programmes (third-party financing and Energy Efficient Mortgages) leads to an increase in the adoption rate of energy-efficient renovations. We examine whether the introduction of a contractual mechanism that intrinsically promotes trust between the parties (one-stop-shop) can increase the adoption rate, therefore assessing the effect of uncertainty in energy savings and work quality and liquidity constraints on energy efficiency investment.
    We find that both financing programmes increase the probability of choosing an energy renovation over the opt-out option. Nevertheless, participants exposed to the mortgage programme have a preference for the status quo (not renovating), unlike those exposed to third-party financing, that we explain by the insurance the program provides via the third-party and mutual interests. This explains why the group offered the energy-efficient mortgage is more inclined to choose renovation scenarios that include an administrative facilitator, highlighting the importance of procedural support and risk transfer in the decision-making process. We provide policy recommandation on cases in which these funding mechanisms could play a central role in carbon mitigation policy in the residential sector.
